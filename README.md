# Booze-Buddy

# Description
We have created a website that allows users to search alcoholic drink recipes by the drink name or ingredient. Once a user has searched by drink name they will be presented with an image of the drink as well as the recipe and drink name. If a user searches by ingredient they will be presented with an image of that ingredient and a list of drinks that include that ingredient. Once users are presented with the list of drinks they are able to search the drink name within the drink name section which is where they will receive the recipe for the drink.
